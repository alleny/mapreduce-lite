    # For Debian/Ubuntu Linux
{{{
sudo apt-get install gcc
}}}
    # For Mac OS X, install XCode

== Install Protobuf ==
    # Download source code package (I am using `protobuf-2.3.0.tar.bz2`) from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf
    # Unpack the source code anywhere (e.g., `./protobuf-2.3.0`)
    # You need to install protobuf into the standard path, e.g., `/usr/local`, because we need CMake be able to find the protobuf compiler:
